# 📊 IoT Monitoring Dashboard  

A modern IoT dashboard for monitoring devices, displaying real-time data insights using **charts, tables, and status indicators**. This project is a **side project** using **mock data** to simulate real IoT device monitoring.  

## 🚀 Features  

- 📡 **Device Monitoring** – View status and performance of IoT devices.  
- 📊 **Real-time Charts & Graphs** – Visualize sensor data with interactive charts.  
- 🔄 **Mock Data Simulation** – No actual IoT devices required; data is dynamically generated.  
- 🎨 **Modern UI** – Built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and Magic UI for a sleek experience.  
- 🌐 **REST API (Mock)** – Uses Node.js and Express to serve device data.  

## 🛠 Tech Stack  

### **Frontend**  
- **Next.js** – Fast and optimized frontend framework.  
- **Tailwind CSS** – Ensures a modern and responsive design.  
- **shadcn/ui & Magic UI** – Provides high-quality, prebuilt components.  
- **Axios** – Fetches mock IoT data from the backend.  

### **Backend (Mock API)**  
- **Node.js & Express** – Handles API requests and serves mock IoT data.  

## 📡 How It Works  
1. The frontend fetches mock IoT data via REST API.  
2. Data is displayed using **charts, tables, and status indicators**.  
3. Users can **filter, sort, and analyze** device performance.  

## 🎯 Future Enhancements  
- 🔗 **Live Data Integration** (via MQTT/WebSockets).  
- 📍 **Device Location Tracking** on interactive maps.  
- 📢 **Alerts & Notifications** for device failures.  

This project is a great **starting point** for building a full-fledged IoT dashboard! 🚀
